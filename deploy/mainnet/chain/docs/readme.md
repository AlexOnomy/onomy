# Onomy Mainnet

At [Onomy Protocol](https://onomy.io/), we are excited to launch our public mainnet for the Onomy Network (ONET)
blockchain.

As a Cosmos Tendermint-based chain, the ONET works via a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, where the ANOM and it's
10^18 NOM representation is bonded to validators either directly or through delegation. The ONET will power the Onomy
Exchange (hybrid DEX) and Onomy Reserve (stablecoin issuance), whilst operating with 100x the efficiency of Ethereum and
facilitating inter-chain asset trading of NOM, Onomy's stablecoins, and other crypto assets.

This iteration is also focused on proving out the Ethereum bridge as well as deployment methodology and other custom
modules for the upcoming production Onomy incentivized mainnet and mainnet.

The documentation here will guide you through the steps needed to run full nodes, obtain ANOM/NOM, and try out the Onomy
Network.

To join us or discuss the current mainnet, kindly get in touch with us via [Discord](https://discord.gg/27r73SYAkQ)
. More focused discussions are possible on our [official forum](https://forum.onomy.io/).
